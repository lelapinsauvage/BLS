  "paragraph_1": "Director & founder of Buterin L'Estrange, Tony has contributed over 25 years of hands-on hospitality and commercial construction leadership to the Sydney and Central Coast markets. Built on a simple conviction — that no client deserves to feel like a number — Tony started BLS to reintroduce human connection and intentional craft into every build.",
  "paragraph_2": "Under his guidance, the BLS team is intentionally petite and fiercely detail-driven: every build benefits from direct oversight, unquestioned accountability, and the same sense of ownership Tony brings to every project. The result? Spaces built to last—both structurally and reputationally.",
